### Key Terms

{:dl .dl-horizontal}
Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
: It is the maximum targeted period in which data might be lost from an IT service due to a major incident.

Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
: This is is the targeted duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be restored after a disaster (or disruption) in order to avoid unacceptable consequences associated with a break in business continuity.

Containers
: Are an operating-system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a control host using a single Linux kernel

Elastic Container Service (ECS)
: is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

Elastic Beanstalk
: is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

Serverless Architecture
:  In the cloud, server-less architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain servers to carry out traditional compute activities. For example, storage services can act as static websites, removing the need for web servers; and event services can host your code for you.
